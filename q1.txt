Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP is hyper texr transport protocal its working on sending requst to the data base and the data base responce to the user.

1.HTTP1 
 *HTTP1 sending requst to the data base and the data base responce to the user in single way 
 *HTTP1 is transfer all the requsts & responce in plain text message form
 *HTTP1 is works on textual formate
 *HTTP/1.1 that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources

2.HTTP2:
* HTTP2 is works on binary formate
* HTTP2 is fully multiplexed so one tcp connection is required for multiple requests
* HTTP2 can use one connection for parallelism 
* HTTP2 is faster and more relibal than HTTP1
* HTTP2 is avoiding network delay by usning multiplexed 

HTTP1:
* It works on the textual format.
* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
* uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
* It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2:
* It works on the binary protocol.
* It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
* It 	It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
* It compresses data by itself.	It uses HPACK for data compression.
